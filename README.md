<body>
<p> I created this archlinux installer for learning bash scripting. I'm still noob and ofcourse there are advance installer out there. I tried to make the script easier as far as I could so that anyone can understand whats in there. I suggest to try this on virtualbox first if you are first in arch linux. HAPPY ARCHING! :) </p>
